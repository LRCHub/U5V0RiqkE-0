[00:03.91] Thank you so much for getting this one to number one
[00:29.91] 
[00:18.17] You're insecure, don't know what for
[00:21.72] You're turning heads when you walk through the door
[00:25.92] Don't need make-up to cover-up
[00:29.44] Being the way that you are is enough
[00:47.44] 
[00:34.56] Everyone else in the room can see it
[00:38.27] Everyone else, but you (come on Bournemouth)
[01:00.27] 
[00:41.19] Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
[00:45.18] The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
[00:48.72] But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
[00:52.62] You don't know, oh-oh
[00:55.28] You don't know you're beautiful
[01:10.78] 
[00:57.08] If only you saw what I can see
[01:00.20] You'll understand why I want you so desperately
[01:04.20] Right now, I'm lookin' at you, and I can't believe
[01:07.96] You don't know, oh-oh
[01:10.53] You don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
[01:14.56] That's what makes you beautiful
[01:30.06] 
[01:19.32] So, c-come on, you got it wrong
[01:23.25] To prove I'm right, I'll put it in a song
[01:27.25] I don't know why you're being shy
[01:31.08] And turn away when I look into your eyes
[01:51.08] 
[01:35.77] Everyone else in the room can see it
[01:39.46] Everyone else, but you (sing it)
[01:55.46] 
[01:42.67] Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
[01:46.36] The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
[01:50.32] But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
[01:54.01] You don't know, oh-oh (sing it)
[01:57.05] You don't know you're beautiful
[02:12.55] 
[01:58.34] If only you saw what I can see
[02:01.78] You'll understand why I want you so desperately
[02:05.65] Right now, I'm lookin' at you, and I can't believe
[02:09.39] You don't know, oh-oh
[02:12.22] You don't know you're beautiful, oh-oh
[02:16.08] That's what makes you beautiful
[02:31.58] 
[02:18.13] Na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na, na (come on, let me see those hands)
[02:21.58] Na-na-na, na-na-na (sing with me)
[02:25.55] Na-na-na, na-na-na, na, na, na
[02:29.33] Na-na-na, na-na-na
[02:38.33] 
[02:32.47] Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
[02:36.27] The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
[02:39.96] But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
[02:43.96] You don't know
[02:46.86] You don't know you're beautiful
[03:02.36] 
[02:47.95] Baby, you light up my world like nobody else
[02:51.76] The way that you flip your hair gets me overwhelmed
[02:55.42] But when you smile at the ground, it ain't hard to tell
[02:59.49] You don't know, oh-oh
